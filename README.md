# fake-face-detection
This is Our College Minor Project
Detction of fake faces through supervised learning two classifier SVM and Logistic Regression Classifier.
The drawback came out throughout the development of this project is that it lacks to classify low pixel(intensity) images.
We under development of a Deep-fake-face-detction model through deep learning architecture.
